// we can't dtermine whether a pointer points to a valid pointer just by knowing
// it's a pointer. It's like saying if we have a type of 'void pointer' we would
// know the type of variable its pointing to.

// the point is, even though we have an IDE to help us with possible errors the
// compiler is not force to actually check whether the pointed object is valid
// or not... It's up to the user.
